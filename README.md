# Interview Scheduler
An **interview scheduler** app that lets a user book, edit and delete an appointment at a selected day and time.

- When booking an appointment, the user can type the student name and select a list of interviewers.
- When deleting an appointment, it will have a confirmation message first before fully deleting the appointment.
- A user can also edit the name of student/interviewer.
- The user can also see how many spots are remaining for the selected day.
